    Program Description: You play as Mr. White, an experimental test subject who has been drugged and put into a deep sleep. In your sleep, you dream about waking up in a room that contains
                         three coloured portals - a red one, a green one, and a blue one. You must choose the portal that will lead to your safety, but be wary, for if you choose the wrong
                         one, you will suffer a terrible death and will never wake from your sleep. Now...which colour is your favourite?

    Revision History:
